What I did: I did the whole assignment myself.

Code file descriptions:

Makefile - This file compiles the executables for server#, servermain, admin and student, where # is in {A, B, C}.

server#.cpp - The # again is in {A, B, C}, and these files are all the same apart from 2 things, which
are the values given to MYPORT, and myServer. This file is responsible for reading the
backend data files, and also for sending the student ids and department statistics to servermain.

servermain.cpp - The main server which initially boots up, sets up sockets to communicate to each backend server, and
requests a list of departments from each server one by one. After this point, it will wait for incoming TCP connections from either admin or student, and
respond to the queries of either type a.) or b.) as listed in the project description.

student.cpp - The file which is used to establish a TCP connection to servermain for student type users, and only allows for queries of type a.)

admin.cpp - The file which is used to establish a TCP connection to servermain for admin type users, and supports both types of queries.

Message format:

All my messages are sent as lists of characters separated by semicolons. There is one exception to this which is
a special command I created called '\*list' which is sent from servermain to server# which then should fetch all the
department information.

Reused Code:

A lot of my code was initially based on Beej's guide, but I made many modifications myself.
Every place where I used Beej's guide code is commented // Note: from Beej's guide.
